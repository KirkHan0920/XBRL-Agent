{"topic": "An attribute of an element to indicate that the element is only used in a hierarchy to group related elements together. An abstract element cannot be used to tag data in an instance document.", "output": "In the context of the eXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL), \"abstract\" refers to an element or concept that is defined within the XBRL taxonomy but does not have a direct, concrete representation in the data file. \n\n### 1. Abstract Element\nAn abstract element in XBRL is a conceptual construct that serves as a blueprint for other elements, often referred to as derived elements. These derived elements inherit properties and constraints from the abstract element, allowing them to be used consistently across multiple instances of an XBRL report. Abstract elements do not exist in the actual data file; instead, they are resolved into specific elements during the processing of an XBRL instance document.\n\nFor example, consider an abstract element named `Revenue` which defines a set of constraints such as being a monetary amount, having a specific period reference, and so on. Any derived elements that inherit this `Revenue` abstract element will also need to adhere to these constraints, such as `TotalRevenue`, `OperatingRevenue`, etc., without having to redefine all the constraints.\n\n### 2. Abstract Taxonomy\nAn abstract taxonomy is a foundational component of an XBRL system that contains definitions of concepts, relationships between those concepts, and rules for how those concepts can be represented in an XBRL instance document. It includes abstract elements, which are the building blocks for creating more specific elements. The abstract taxonomy is designed to be flexible and scalable, allowing it to accommodate various types of financial reporting requirements without needing to redefine core concepts each time new reports are developed.\n\n### 3. Abstract Constraints\nAbstract constraints are rules that govern the structure and content of elements within an XBRL taxonomy. They define what values an element can take, how it should relate to other elements, and any other conditions that must be met. Abstract constraints are part of the taxonomy definition and apply to any element that inherits them. This ensures consistency and accuracy in the data reported by different entities, regardless of the specific elements they use.\n\n### 4. Abstract Reference\nAn abstract reference is a placeholder in an XBRL instance document that points to a specific instance of an abstract element defined in the taxonomy. When an XBRL instance is processed, the abstract reference is resolved to the actual element it represents based on the context in which it appears. This allows for a more streamlined and flexible way of defining and referencing complex structures in financial reports, ensuring that the same underlying concepts can be used across different reports or filings.\n\n### Importance of Abstract Concepts in XBRL\nThe use of abstract concepts in XBRL is crucial"}
{"topic": "A property of an element such as its name, balance, data type, and whether the element is abstract. Attributes of XBRL US GAAP Taxonomy elements cannot be changed.", "output": "In the context of the eXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL), \"attribute\" refers to a specific piece of data that is associated with an element and provides additional information or clarification about that element. Attributes can be thought of as a type of metadata, which adds context to the underlying data.\n\n### Definition:\nAn attribute in XBRL is a characteristic or property of an element, providing further details about its value or meaning. It is defined within the XBRL taxonomy, specifically within the conceptual schema, where it specifies the type of data (e.g., numeric, date, text), the format, and any constraints that must be met.\n\n### Structure:\n- **Attribute Name**: This is the name given to the attribute, which helps in identifying and referencing it within the XBRL document.\n- **Value**: The actual data value associated with the attribute. This can be a string, number, date, or any other type of data depending on the attribute definition.\n- **Role**: Sometimes, attributes can be associated with roles within an XBRL instance document. Roles help in defining how elements are used in the report, such as being part of a calculation or being aggregated.\n- **Type**: Specifies the data type of the attribute (e.g., integer, decimal, date).\n- **Precision**: Determines the number of significant digits for numeric attributes.\n- **Length**: Specifies the maximum number of characters allowed for text attributes.\n- **Pattern**: Can define a regular expression that the attribute value must match.\n- **Unit**: For numeric attributes, defines the unit of measurement (e.g., USD, kg).\n\n### Example:\nConsider an element `Revenue` in an XBRL taxonomy. An attribute might be added to this element to specify the currency in which the revenue is reported:\n\n```xml\n<xs:element name=\"Revenue\">\n  <xs:complexType>\n    <xs:simpleContent>\n      <xs:extension base=\"xs:string\">\n        <xs:attribute name=\"currency\" type=\"xs:string\" use=\"required\"/>\n      </xs:extension>\n    </xs:simpleContent>\n  </xs:complexType>\n</xs:element>\n```\n\nIn this example, `Revenue` is the element, and `currency` is the attribute. It's required and of type `xs:string`, meaning the user must provide the currency code when reporting revenue.\n\n### Usage:\nAttributes are crucial for enhancing the clarity and utility of financial data in XBRL documents. They allow for more precise reporting, especially in complex financial scenarios where context is"}
